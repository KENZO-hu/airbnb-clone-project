Airbnb Clone Project

##  Project Overview

*StayEase* is a full-stack accommodation booking platform inspired by Airbnb. Developed as part of the *ALX Software Engineering Program (ProDev Back-End)*, it simulates real-world development by integrating backend logic, database design, authentication, and deployment practices.

This project showcases a robust system for property listings, user authentication, booking flow, and secure payments‚Äîbuilt with scalability, maintainability, and teamwork in mind.

###  Project Goals

- Build a scalable and secure backend architecture  
- Design and manage a relational database for property booking  
- Implement RESTful APIs and JWT-based authentication  
- Enable a smooth and secure booking process  
- Integrate CI/CD workflows and containerization  
- Document the system and collaborate in a team-based setup
